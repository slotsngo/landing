It's important to note that vague sources like \"the internet\" or \"my friend\" are unacceptable; clarity and specificity are essential.\n				Once you've determined your traffic sources, visit the Slots'n'go Partners registration page. After registration, you must create a referral link to invite players to the casino. Remember that it's strictly prohibited for partners to register friends or family using their referral links. By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to becoming a successful partner in the Slots'n'go Affiliate Program! If you have further questions or need assistance, our support team is here to help.\n				"},{question:"How to create a referral link?",answer:'\n				Creating a referral link in the Slots\'n\'go Affiliate Program is straightforward.

Next, select the landing page where the link will be used in the "Landing Page" field.

If you have any questions or need assistance, don\'t hesitate to contact our support team.\n				'},{question:"How is Partner RevShare commission сalculated?",answer:"\n				The Partner RevShare commission is determined by the percentage of revenue generated by players you refer to the Slots'n'go platform. For instance, if you have a revenue share agreement of 30% and your referred players incur losses of 10,000 multiplied by 30%, which equals $3,000.\n				This transparent commission structure allows you to earn based on the revenue created by your referrals, making it an effective way to profit from your marketing efforts. If you have any questions about how this works or need more details, please don't hesitate to contact our support team!\n				"},{question:"What kinds of commission plans are available?",answer:"\n				We offer three commission plans to suit different preferences and strategies:\nRevenue Share: With this plan, you earn a percentage of the revenue generated by your players. For example, if you have a Revenue Share deal set at 30% and your players lose $10,000 on sports bets, your commission would be calculated as follows: $10,000 * 30% = $3,000.\nCPA (Cost Per Action): This plan allows you to earn a fixed amount for specific player actions outlined in the agreement, such as registrations or deposits exceeding a certain amount. For instance, if your CPA deal pays $20 for every deposit greater than $6 and your players make deposits of $10, $25, $5, $40, and $100, you would earn a total CPA commission of $80 (from the deposits of $10, $25, $40, and $100).\nHybrid: This is a combination of the Revenue Share and CPA plans. For example, if you have a Hybrid deal with a Revenue Share of 30% and a CPA of $10 for each deposit greater than $5, your earnings would vary based on player activity. So, if your players make one deposit over $5 and lose $300, you earn $100.\nChoose the plan that best aligns with your goals and player engagement strategy!\n				"},{question:"What are the time limits within which invited players bring revenue?",answer:"\n				There are no time limits associated with the RevShare program. Invited players will generate monthly revenue for you as long as they remain active and continue to make deposits.
